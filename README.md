# Solassitude - UNDER CONSTRUCTION

*** NOTE: NOT READY TO BE BUILT YET ***

An immersive, procedurally generated virtual experience taking place far, far away from our Universe.
(this is an indie game in progress made with OpenGL)

NOTE: You must use the GLFW version from my GitHub account to compile the project (it uses a function defined in PR glfw#2072, which is not merged currently)

You can look up [trivia](TRIVIA.md) file for unordered information.
